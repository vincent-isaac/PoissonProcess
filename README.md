# Poisson Process

# Aim : 
To find the probability of that  (i) exactly 4 customers arrive (ii) more than 4 customers arrive (iii) fewer than 4 customers in 2 minute  arrival. Given that the customers arrive at a bank according to a Poisson process with mean rate of 3 per minute  during a time interval of 2 min. 


# Software required :  

Python

# Theory:

The Poisson process is one of the most widely-used counting processes. It is usually used in scenarios where we are counting the occurrences of certain events that appear to happen at a certain rate, but completely at random (without a certain structure). For example, suppose that from historical data, we know that earthquakes occur in a certain area with a rate of 2 per month. Other than this information, the timings of earthquakes seem to be completely random. Thus, we conclude that the Poisson process might be a good model for earthquakes. In practice, the Poisson process or its extensions have been used to model.
